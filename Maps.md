# Cameroon Density of Population Map

This map is among the best one that I done. It represents perfectly the 3D visualization for the density of population in Cameroon. This map take inspiration on my first day in the 30 Day Map Challenge. So, I decided to produce a map showing the population density of Cameroon. With a population of over 20 million in 2020, it's easy to make out the densely populated cities in Cameroon's demographic landscape

# DR Congo Density of Population Map 

Demographic growth in DR Congo is evident, with an estimated population of 102 million in 2023. Although an area of 2 345 410kmÂ², the population is concentrated in cities such as Kinshasa, Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi. Special tip to Kisangani City, which is one of the mosted populated cities in DR Congo, but whose urban expansion through the years reduced the effect of population density.

 # Ethiopia Density of Population Map

I'm pleased to unveil a 3D map showing Ethiopia's population density. Did you know that Ethiopia had a population of over 100 million in 2020. It's one of the most populated countries in Africa. The population is mainly concentrated in cities such as Addis-Abeba, Baher Dar and Gondar.
